	 * @brief MPI (Message Passing Interface) functions
	 *
	 * @code
	 * #include <hnc/mpi.hpp>
	 * @endcode
	 *
	 * With MPI you can write distributed program to:
	 * - increase performances
	 * - solve a bigger problem who can do with only one computer
	 *
	 * @b From @b Wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface @n
	 * Message Passing Interface (MPI) is a standardized and portable message-passing system designed by a group of researchers from academia and industry to function on a wide variety of parallel computers. The standard defines the syntax and semantics of a core of library routines useful to a wide range of users writing portable message-passing programs in Fortran 77 or the C programming language. Several well-tested and efficient implementations of MPI include some that are free and in the public domain. These fostered the development of a parallel software industry, and there encouraged development of portable and scalable large-scale parallel applications.
	 *
	 * To use MPI code, you need Boost.MPI and Boost.Serialization @n
	 * You can add this in your CMakeLists.txt
	 * @code
	 * find_package(Boost COMPONENTS mpi serialization)
	 * if (Boost_FOUND)
	 * 	# Boost.MPI and Boost.Serialization
	 * 	set(boost_mpi_serialization "${Boost_LIBRARIES}")
	 * 	message(STATUS "Boost.MPI and Boost.Serialization found :) ${boost_mpi_serialization}")
	 * 	# MPI compiler
	 * 	find_program(MPICXX_COMPILER NAMES mpic++ mpicxx mpiCC mpicc)
	 * 	if (MPICXX_COMPILER)
	 * 		# Change the compiler
	 * 		message(STATUS "MPI C++ compiler found = ${MPICXX_COMPILER}")
	 * 		set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER ${MPICXX_COMPILER})
	 * 	else()
	 * 		message(STATUS "MPI C++ compiler not found :(")
	 * 	endif()
	 * 	# MPI run
	 * 	find_program(MPIRUN_EXE NAMES mpirun)
	 * 	if (MPIRUN_EXE)
	 * 		message(STATUS "mpirun executable found = ${MPIRUN_EXE}")
	 * 	else()
	 * 		message(STATUS "mpirun executable not found :(")
	 * 	endif()
	 * else()
	 * 	message(STATUS "Boost.MPI and Boost.Serialization not found :(")
	 * endif()
	 * 
	 * # ...
	 *
	 * # Create the executable
	 * add_executable(your_exe your_exe.cpp)
	 * target_link_libraries(your_exe ${boost_mpi_serialization})
	 * @endcode
	 * 
	 * For quick test, if you use GCC from the command line and Boost is installed, you can link directly with:
	 * @code
	 * -lboost_mpi -lboost_serialization
	 * @endcode
	 *
	 * On Debian GNU/Linux distribution you can install the packages:
	 * @code
	 * openmpi-bin openmpi-dev libboost-serialization-dev libboost-mpi-dev
	 * @endcode
	 *
	 * To run a program with MPI, run your program with:
	 * @code
	 * mpirun -np number_of_processors your_exe
	 * @endcode
	 * 
	 * If you want compile without Boost.MPI, you can define the macro
	 * @code
	 * #define NO_HNC_Boost_MPI
	 * @endcode
