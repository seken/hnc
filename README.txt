| Installation of hnc |
 ---------------------
 
With CMake
----------

Your C++ compiler must support common features of C++11
GCC 4.7 works (GCC 4.7.2 is in Debian Wheezy)

Use CMake to build hnc:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. #-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install/hnc
make
# make doxygen
# make test
make install # su -c "make install" # sudo make install
 
Without CMake
-------------
 
hnc is an header-only library, you can copy the include directory in /usr/local or in your project.


 ---------
| Use hnc |
 ---------
 
If you use CMake, add these lines in your CMakeLists.txt:
# hnc
message(STATUS "---")
find_package(hnc REQUIRED)
# See /hnc/installation/path/lib/hnc/hnc-config.cmake for CMake variables

If you have make the documentation, the doxygen is in:
/hnc/installation/path/share/hnc/doxygen/
